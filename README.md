This repo is my endeavor to gather experimental data in one place.
It is mostly related to electrical circuits as of now. I intend to study the non-linear characteristics(if I can find any).
As I conduct the experiments, I will upload the data that I have taken and results from plots.
You are welcome to play with the data and maybe come up with new ways to visualize/interpret it.
You can even let me know if you feel that data taken may be inconsistent with the theory, and I'll try to find out if I've done
anything wrong....

HAPPY EXPERIMENTING!!

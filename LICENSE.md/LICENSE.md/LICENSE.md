The data in this repository are for everyone to use freely, in order to replicate the same observations as I myself found out.
However if the above is used for purposes other than what is mentioned, then proper citation must be provided.
This is mandatory in case the data is used in form of publication.

But by using the data in this repository, you(the user) agree to the fact that the data is prone to errors that may or may not have creeped in during the experiment
and you are using it at your own discretion. I, in such cases will not be responsible for any issues that you(the user) may face.

And finally, all of it is owned by SCIENCE!

Thank you.
